# python-api-challenge

In part one of this assignment, I used Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer this question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?" I wrote a Python script to visualize the weather of 573 cities of varying distance from the equator using citipy and OpenWeatherMap API. I created several visualizations to help analyze the data and included some observations at the top of my notebook. I also saved the data into a csv file for the second part of the assignment. 

In part two, I used the file I created in part one along with gmaps and Google APIs to display two maps. The first is a heatmap showing the humidity of all of the cities. I then narrowed the list of cities down to those with vacation worthy parameters such as ideal temperature, humidity and cloudiness. Using this reduced list, I created a map with markers for hotels in those cities. 
There is also a folder with all of my output files from both parts and screenshots of the maps created.
